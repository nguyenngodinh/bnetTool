# bnetTool
bayesian network gui tool
##### Original version is developed by TrungVV (trungvv91@gmail.com) with features:
###### - Graphical creating bayesian network.
###### - Inference based on probability, statiscal theory.
###### - Learning with complete and uncomplete data.
##### This version have improvement by NguyenND (nguyenngodinh@outlook.com)
###### - Increase speed on infering and learning with algorithm of belief propagation.
###### - Can solve the big size of network and loopy graph.
